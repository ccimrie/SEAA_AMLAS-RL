# Stage 4 

The yaml file contains the architecture of the DDPG model. To reproduce the plots/stats presented in the paper run the python files in `internal_test_results`. To train a model, first remove the keras files from `rl_model_files` and then run `python3 train_rl_vehicle.py`, but this will overwrite the results in this repo. You can then view the new results in the same way as before.
